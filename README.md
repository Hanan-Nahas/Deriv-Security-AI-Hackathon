# Deriv AI Shield

Deriv AI Shield is an AI Web Application Firewall (AI WAF) that protects LLM apps and AI agents from prompt injection, jailbreaks, and data exfiltration. The WAF is the **core** of the system; the **AI Pentester** is an add-on feature that stress-tests the WAF and reports gaps so defenses can improve. The system is designed to learn & adapt.

## Focus
- **Primary:** AI WAF for real-time input/output defense and behavior monitoring.
- **Add-on:** AI Pentester for continuous adversarial testing and reporting.

## Why it matters
Prompt injection is the SQL injection of the AI era. This project provides layered defense (input filtering, output redaction, and behavior monitoring) so AI systems can be safely deployed in real-world environments.
